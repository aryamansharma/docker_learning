1. Docker is used generally for bg projects and big teams.
2. Suppose we have a application on our machine, and we want to run the application in some other machine, 
    so in other machine we have to manually download all its dependencies, and if we forget to install any of the dependency the application
    wont run. In this scenario Docker can be very helpful.
3. we have Docker image file, which contains the instructions to create containers. 
    basically image file is an executeable file and it works like a Class, just like class we create objects or insances from it, 
    we create containers from image.
4. Containers is a like container which contains the application and all its dependencies, which we can run on different machines,
    or on a production server.
5. we share docker image to create containers so we can say, Docker adds an advantage of portability as docker images are very minimal in size.
6. for downloading docker in our system we download docker desktop.
7. tag is basically a version or a variant of an image.
8. we can run multiple containers on a single machine. thats actually one of the core advantage of docker.
9. we have docker image layers, so for a image, we can have multiple layers, but the 1st layer will always be the base layer, 
    after that we can create multiple layers, and the last layer is called the container layer
10. the container layer is the layer which we use to create containers and it is the only mutable layer, in which we can make changes, 
    other layers are read only layers or we can say are immutable.
11. suppose we have an image on our machine and we try to download another verison of that image, so there will be some common layers between these images,
    so the layers which are common for both the version will not be downloade, only the different layers will be downloaded.
