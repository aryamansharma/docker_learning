1. Docker is used generally for bg projects and big teams.
2. Suppose we have a application on our machine, and we want to run the application in some other machine, 
    so in other machine we have to manually download all its dependencies, and if we forget to install any of the dependency the application
    wont run. In this scenario Docker can be very helpful.
3. we have Docker image file, which contains the instructions to create containers. 
    basically image file is an executeable file and it works like a Class, just like class we create objects or insances from it, 
    we create containers from image.
4. Containers is a like container which contains the application and all its dependencies, which we can run on different machines,
    or on a production server.
5. we share docker image to create containers so we can say, Docker adds an advantage of portability as docker images are very minimal in size.
